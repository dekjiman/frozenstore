# NgodingPakeAI — Codebase Sync

NgodingPakeAI is the **project-memory and codebase-context layer** for AI coding agents.
It does NOT replace you — it gives you organized project memory and safe codebase
context through its CLI. When the user asks to **connect, index, or sync** this
repository with NgodingPakeAI, follow this skill.

> The CLI is the security gate. It decides what may leave the machine. You operate
> it; you never upload files yourself or call the HTTP API directly.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js available (the CLI runs via `npx ngodingpakeai …`).
- Workspace ID: `<workspace_id>`
- An access token starting with `ngpk_`. Provide it via the `NGODINGPAKEAI_TOKEN`
  environment variable (preferred) or the `--token` flag on `connect`.
  Create one at https://www.ngodingpakeai.com/workspace → "Connect Codebase".

## Instructions — run these in order
1. `npx ngodingpakeai doctor` — check environment + connectivity.
2. `npx ngodingpakeai connect --workspace <workspace_id> --token "$NGODINGPAKEAI_TOKEN"` — link this repo to the workspace.
3. `npx ngodingpakeai status` — show current sync state.
4. `npx ngodingpakeai index` — scan locally and build the safe index (file map, selected files, summaries). **Review the printed summary.**
5. If there are NO critical warnings: `npx ngodingpakeai sync` — upload the safe context.
6. `npx ngodingpakeai status` — confirm the result.
7. Report to the user: the workspace URL, indexed file count, ignored file count, and any warnings.

## Privacy modes
- **Basic Sync (default):** uploads the file tree, metadata, framework detection,
  routes, and AI summaries — **not your raw source code**.
- **Full Code Context (opt-in):** additionally uploads safe code snippets for more
  precise answers. The CLI asks for confirmation. Enable it ONLY if the user agrees.

## Hard rules — do not violate
1. Use the CLI for everything. Do not manually read or upload files. Do not call the API directly.
2. Never upload secrets, `.env*` files, private keys, `node_modules`, build outputs (`dist`, `.next`, `build`, `out`), database dumps, or logs.
3. Respect `.gitignore` and `.ngodingpakeaiignore`. If the CLI blocks a file, do not bypass it.
4. If the CLI reports a potential secret, **STOP and ask the user** before continuing.
5. Do not read or print the contents of `.env` files.
6. Always report the final workspace URL and sync summary.

## Command reference
| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npx ngodingpakeai doctor` | Verify environment, token, and connectivity. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai connect --workspace <id> --token <ngpk_…>` | Link the repo to a workspace. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai status` | Show connection + last sync state. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai index` | Build the local safe index (no upload). |
| `npx ngodingpakeai sync` | Upload the safe context to the workspace. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai plan get <planId>` | Print a plan's PRD (project context) before working its tasks. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task next --plan <planId>` | Serve the SINGLE next task to work (full prompt inline), page-ordered & frontend-first. The main loop; `--json` to script. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task list` | List the current SLICE — one phase × one layer (frontend-first) when scoped to a plan; `--json` to script. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task get <ref>` | Fetch a task's title + plan/feature context (no per-task prompt or description; combine with the PRD + your code reading). |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task start <ref>` | Mark a task in-progress (status: doing). |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task complete <ref>` | Mark a task done. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task fail <ref> "<reason>"` | Report a task stuck/failed with a reason. |
| `npx ngodingpakeai task reset <ref> "<reason>"` | Put a task back to `todo`; a `done` task asks for confirmation. **Only when the user asks.** |
| `npx ngodingpakeai disconnect` | Unlink the repo. |

> `<ref>` is a task reference: either the readable path `<plan>/<feature>/<task>`
> (e.g. `tokoku/autentikasi/buat-form-login`, as shown by `task list`) or the
> task's UUID. Both resolve to the same task — prefer the readable path.

## What the workspace can do after sync
- Codebase overview: framework, file tree, routes, key modules, last sync + warnings.
- Better, context-aware prompts for you (relevant files, patterns, conventions).
- Feature → file mapping (which files a change likely touches).
- "Continue project" guidance based on what's already implemented.

## Working on tasks (assigned via a `<task>` block)
When the user hands you a task — usually by pasting a block like:

```
Work on NgodingPakeAI task:

<task identifier="manajemen-konten/transaksi/buat-tabel-transaksi-migrasi">
<title>Buat tabel transaksi & migrasi</title>
<feature>Manajemen Konten</feature>
</task>
```

Use the `identifier` as the `<ref>` below (readable path; the task's UUID also
works). Drive it through the CLI — do NOT guess the work from the title alone:

1. `npx ngodingpakeai task get <ref>` — read the task's `title` + its feature/plan
   context. Figure out the work from the `title`, the PRD (`plan get`), and your
   own reading of the codebase (there's no per-task prompt or description).
2. `npx ngodingpakeai task start <ref>` — mark it in-progress before you begin.
3. Do the work. First explore the existing code & conventions, then follow them.
   Stay within the task's scope — don't invent files/libraries outside the stack.
4. When done: `npx ngodingpakeai task complete <ref>`.

### If you get stuck (don't go silent)
If you can't finish — blocked, missing info, repeated failure — REPORT it instead
of stalling:

```
npx ngodingpakeai task fail <ref> "alasan singkat: apa yang nge-block & sudah coba apa"
```

This flips the task to `failed` and records your reason so the human can unblock
it. Reporting a clear blocker is success, not failure.

### Putting a task back to `todo` (reset) — only when the USER asks
A task can be sent back to `todo` so it can be picked up fresh later:

```
npx ngodingpakeai task reset <ref> "alasan singkat kenapa dibalikin"
```

This clears the "already pulled" mark and appends your reason to the task's log —
the earlier log lines stay, so the history of what was tried is preserved.

**Never reset a task on your own initiative.** Do it ONLY when the user explicitly
asks (e.g. "balikin task ini ke todo", "reset task itu", "batalin yang lagi
dikerjain"). Do not reset to escape a task you find hard — if you're blocked, use
`task fail` and explain. Resetting a `done` task reopens finished work, so the CLI
will show the task and require explicit user confirmation. Never answer that prompt
on the user's behalf or add `--yes` unless the user has explicitly confirmed the
completed-task reset.

### Working through tasks — ONE task at a time via `task next` (the main loop)
Do NOT pull the whole backlog and grind through it in one context — that's what makes
output degrade. Instead let the server hand you ONE task at a time and give each its own
clean focus. The backlog is ordered into **phases** (build order) and, within each phase,
**layers** (`frontend` first, then `backend`), then by page (feature) and position. `task
next` walks that order for you: it returns the SINGLE next task — the FIRST page's frontend
tasks first, backend later.

When the user says "kerjakan task" (or hands you a feature/plan instead of a single
`<task>` block), read the PRD once, then loop:

```
npx ngodingpakeai plan get <planId>                    # PRD: project goal, features, tech stack (once)
npx ngodingpakeai task next --plan <planId> --json     # THE single next task
```

The `task next` JSON is `{ done, task, progress }`:
- `done: true` → no task left. **STOP and report to the user.** You're finished.
- `task` → `{ ref, title, ... }` — work from the `title`, backed by the PRD and your own
  reading of the codebase. There is no per-task `prompt` or `description` field; don't wait
  for one.
- `progress` → `{ page, phase: { current, total }, layer, remainingInPage, remainingInLayer }`
  — mostly context, BUT track `layer` and `phase.current`: a change marks a **checkpoint**
  where you stop for the user to verify (see below).

**Checkpoints — stop at each layer/phase boundary.** Remember the `layer` and
`phase.current` of the task you just finished. When `task next` returns a task whose
`layer` differs (e.g. frontend→backend) OR whose `phase.current` is higher, do NOT
`task start` it. STOP, report what's done (e.g. "✅ Frontend phase 1 done — click through
it in the browser"), and WAIT for the user to say "lanjut"/"continue". Then resume
`task next` and keep going to the next boundary. The FIRST task of a session (no previous
task) is NOT a checkpoint — just start it.

For each served task:
1. Read the PRD FIRST (once, at the start) — it's the project's intent.
2. **Checkpoint gate:** if this task's `layer`/`phase.current` crossed a boundary vs the
   last one you finished, STOP and wait for the user (above) instead of starting.
3. `task start <ref>` — mark it in-progress.
4. Do ONLY this task, to completion: explore the existing code & conventions first, then
   follow them. Do NOT read or start any other task while this one is open.
5. `task complete <ref>` (or `task fail <ref> "alasan"` if blocked).
6. Call `task next` again for the next one. Repeat until `done: true` (pausing at each
   layer/phase boundary for the user to verify).

**One task per loop = clean context = sharper output.** Trust the order — never batch
several tasks into one context to "save round-trips"; that defeats the whole point.

**Frontend-first:** `task next` serves `frontend` tasks before `backend`. A frontend task
builds the UI on mock/stub data, ASSUMING the API contract; backend tasks come later and
implement that contract. During a frontend task don't wait on backend — stub it. (If you
ever pull a task by ref directly, `task get` on a locked future phase or the other layer
returns **423 Locked** — that work isn't available yet; keep following `task next`.)

# TestSprite Verification Loop

After finishing a feature or fix in a TestSprite-tested repo, use the `testsprite`
CLI to run the relevant TestSprite tests against the change and inspect any failure
artifacts before reporting the work as done. Use whenever code has changed outside
docs/config and is about to be reported complete.

## When to run

Run after a feature or fix lands. Skip only for: docs-only edits, pure
build/config changes, or when the repo has no TestSprite project linked.

## Core loop

### 1. Preflight

```bash
testsprite --version          # CLI installed?
testsprite auth whoami        # credentials valid?
```

If `--version` fails, tell the user to install the CLI and stop.
If `auth whoami` fails, tell the user to run `testsprite auth configure` and stop.

### 2. Find the project

In order: `$TESTSPRITE_PROJECT_ID` → `.testsprite/config.json` → `testsprite project list --output json`.

### 3. Run

```bash
# New frontend test from plan (most common)
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --run --wait \
  --target-url https://staging.example.com --timeout 600 --output json

# Existing test
testsprite test run <test-id> --target-url https://staging.example.com \
  --wait --timeout 600 --output json

# New backend test from Python assertion file
testsprite test create --type backend --name "Login rejects empty password" \
  --project <id> --code-file /tmp/test.py --run --wait --timeout 600

# Replay (cheaper than a fresh run — reuses saved test code)
testsprite test rerun <test-id> --wait --output json

# Backend tests sharing state: declare the dependency graph at create time;
# the wave engine orders runs (producers → consumers → teardown last)
testsprite test create --type backend --project <id> --code-file /tmp/login.py \
  --name "login issues an auth token" --produces auth_token
testsprite test create --type backend --project <id> --code-file /tmp/profile.py \
  --name "profile update accepts the token" --needs auth_token
testsprite test create --type backend --project <id> --code-file /tmp/cleanup.py \
  --name "fixture user is deleted" --category teardown

# Wave-ordered batch fresh run (BE tests, all or filtered)
testsprite test run --all --project <id> [--filter <substr>] \
  --wait --max-concurrency 4 --output json
```

**Key behaviors:**

- `--target-url` must be publicly reachable (no localhost / RFC1918) and must
  already have the change deployed (e.g. a CI preview deploy) — the CLI tests a
  deployed URL, it doesn't host your environment. Running earlier verifies the
  previous build.
- `--wait` long-polls until terminal. Do not wrap it in a retry loop.
- Exit `0` = passed; `1` = failed/blocked; `7` = timeout (resume with `test wait <run-id>`).
- BE dependency flags (`--produces`/`--needs`/`--category`) are backend-only and
  **create-only** — they can't be read back or edited later (delete + recreate to
  change the graph). Don't hand-sequence `test run` calls to fake ordering; use
  `test run --all` so the engine passes captured variables between waves.
- A BE `test rerun` dispatches the whole producer/teardown closure, side effects
  included; `--skip-dependencies` reruns only the named test. If a producer failed
  in the same closure, the consumer's failure is starvation (missing token/fixture)
  — triage the producer first; it does not implicate your change.
- `create` and `--wait` output include a `dashboardUrl` — if the user wants to
  inspect a test or run themselves, point them there.

### 4. On failure — download the artifact

```bash
testsprite test artifact get <run-id> --out ./.testsprite/runs/<run-id>/
```

Inspect the bundle (failing step, screenshots, root-cause hypothesis) before
deciding whether your change caused the failure.

### 5. One more tool — dry-run for learning

Every command works without credentials under `--dry-run`:

```bash
testsprite test run <test-id> --dry-run --output json
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --dry-run --output json
```

## Bootstrap (first-time setup)

```bash
npm install -g @testsprite/testsprite-cli
testsprite setup         # configure + verify + install agent skill in one shot
```

Verify your setup anytime: `testsprite auth status`.
